# Project Overview
In this project, we aim to forecast the price movement of the S&P 500 stock market index using machine learning techniques.

## Project Workflow
1. Retrieve historical market data using the `yfinance` library  
2. Develop a basic machine learning model and assess its initial performance  
3. Create a custom backtesting framework to evaluate the model more realistically  
4. Refine and enhance the model to improve prediction accuracy
